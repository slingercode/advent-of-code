~~I'm not proud on the solution but I'm a Rust noob so this needs refactor ðŸ™ƒ~~
Now I'm happy with this implementation ðŸ˜„. I don't care if there's a lot of code (`struct`, `impl`...)
the goal is to learn the tricky parts of Rust. For example I learn about the [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) trait in vectors ðŸ‘€
